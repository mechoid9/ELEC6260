ELEC 5260/6260 Problem Set #4

PART #1 (DSP programming)
Shown below is the design of an "IIR direct form type II filter", described in Chapter 5 of the
text. Design a program for the TMS 32C5x DSP, discussed in class, to implement this filter,
using the format of the class examples. Data sample x(n) is to be read from an input port, and
filter output y(n) is to be sent to an output port, as in the "Low Pass Filter" example in the class
slides. The values a1, a2, a3, b0, b1, b2, b3 are constants, stored in program memory. Variables
v0, v1, v2, v3 are to be stored in data memory. You may assume that all values are in the "proper
format" to use for this calculation, as shown in the examples on the class slides.
     1. Submit the source program (typed or hand written)
     2. On the submitted program, show how you have the variables arranged and stored in
         memory.
