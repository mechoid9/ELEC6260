Assignment03 - ELEC6260 Problem Set 2, problem 1

Problem 1 ­ Due Tuesday, 1/29/13 by 11 am.

Do the following in ARM assembly. 
Execute and Debug in the Keil MDK-ARM debugger. 
All program variables are to be 32-bit integers. 
Choose my own test variables.

 Compute: zz = aa*(bb+cc) ­ (dd*35);
 Place aa,bb,cc,dd in your code area, so that you can provide initial values with "DCD"
 assembler directives. Please zz in the data area, so that you can write the result to it. The
 final debug window should show the final value of zz in memory.
