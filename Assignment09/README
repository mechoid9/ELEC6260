ELEC 5260/6260 Problems Set #6
Due Wednesday, 2/27/2013
1. While maintaining the same functionality as before, revise the previous program as follows.
       · Trigger the input handler with an external interrupt signal, generated by a button
           press (rising edge.) Note that you may need to "debounce" the switch in software so
           that the program responds only once to any button press.
       · Change the output handler so that it is executed in response to the SVC (supervisor
           call) instruction.
   As before, the program can be tested in RAM or in flash memory, but the final version is to
   be programmed into the flash memory of the microcontroller, so that the program can be
   demonstrated without being connected to the Keil debugger.
   Print and submit the source program, and also email it to me, and bring your programmed
   board to my office to demonstrate the program.
2. From the end of Chapter 3, answer questions Q3-24, Q3-25 and Q3-26. These deal with
   cache memory.
