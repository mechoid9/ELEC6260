Assignment04 - ELEC6260 Problem Set 2, problems 2 & 3

Problems 2 and 3 ­ Due Friday, 2/1/13 at class time.

Do the following in ARM assembly. 
Execute and Debug in the Keil MDK-ARM debugger. 
All program variables are to be 32-bit integers. 
Choose my own test variables.

P2:

Implement the following C code, to exercise program control statements. Place mm, nn,
jj and cc in the code area, with initial values defined by DCD directives, and place kk
and xx in the data area. Circle the values of kk and xx in the final debug window.

Execute this twice. Once for a TRUE condition, and once for a FALSE condition.

	if ((mm-nn) <15) {
		kk = jj - 5;
		xx = 0;
	} else {
		kk = cc +18;
		xx = 1;
	}

P3:

Implement the following C code, to exercise memory addressing modes to handles arrays.
Place arrays aa and bb in the code area, with initial values. Place variables i and array zz in
the data area. Circle the final values of i and zz in the debug window.

	for(I=0; i<15; i++)
		zz[i] = aa[i] - bb[i] +5;
