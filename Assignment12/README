ELEC 5260/6260 Problems Set #7
Due Monday, 3/25/2013 ­ PART 1
Due Friday, 3/29/2013 ­ PART 2

The goals of this exercise are to study:
       (1) digital-to-analog conversion,
       (2) serial device interfaces (I2C in this case),
       (3) real-time operations, coordinated by programmable timers.
You are to design a musical "tone generator" for the DISCOVERY board, with button-selectable
frequencies. These tones should be heard via the audio mini jack on the board (most standard
"ear buds", headphones, or similar listening device can be plugged into this jack.)
    1. Tones are to be produced by generating sinusoidal signals at the output of the
       microcontroller's built-in digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The output of the DAC is
       connected on the board (via GPIO pin PA4) to analog inputs AIN1A/AIN1B of the Cirrus
       CS43L22 Audio DAC. The CS43L22 drives the headphone (HP) jack on the board.
    2. The tone frequencies are to be those of the eight notes of an increasing C-major scale in
       music (C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C).
    3. The sampling frequency is to be 20KHz. This information plus the tone frequencies will
       be used to generate the data samples to be converted by the DAC.
    4. Initially, no tone should be generated when the board is reset.
    5. The first press of the user button should result in generation of the low C tone.
    6. Subsequent presses of the button should change the tone to the next higher note in the
       scale. (Only one change per button press.) After the high C tone, continue again from the
       low C tone.
    7. If the button is pressed twice within a one-second interval, generation of tones should
       stop. Generation of tones should begin again on the next button press, with the last tone
       that was generated.
    8. LEDs 4-3-5 (in that order) are to display the current tone number (binary numbers 000-
       111 correspond to tones from low C to high C.)
    9. LED 6 is to blink at a rate that is proportional to the tone being generated. Select blinking
       rates that can be distinguished visually.
                LED3                           LED3 (orange) = I/O port pin PD13
                                               LED4 (green) = I/O port pin PD12
       LED4             LED5                   LED5 (red)       = I/O port pin PD14
                                               LED6 (blue)       = I/O port pin PD15
                LED6                           User button (blue) = I/O port pin PA0


PART 2 ­ Generation of tones at the headphones.
  1. Use one of the microcontroller's general-purpose programmable timers, other than the
     system tick timer, to produce the required 20KHz data sampling frequency (generate
     new data samples every 1/20KHz = 0.05msec.)
  2. Convert data samples to analog form with the microcontroller's on-chip digital to analog
     converter (DAC). (Not the DAC on the CS43L22.)
  3. Initialize the CS43L22 to "pass through" to the headphones the analog signal from the
     output of the microcontroller DAC.
  4. Implement the rest of the button press and LED display requirements.
